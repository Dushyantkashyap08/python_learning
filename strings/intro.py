# String: data type, sequence of characters enclosed in quotes

#ways to write string
a = "this is a string" #double quotes
b = 'this is a string' #single quotes
c = '''this is also a string''' #triple single quotes

print(a,"\n",b ,"\n",c)

#a string is immutable means if we want to change any character of it then it is not possible 
name = "keshav" #like we cannot change 's' to any other letter
